# job_slave_tracker

I created this bot because I'm currently juggling work, studying, and trying to code new projects at night (yes, I'm that crazy!). With so much going on, I often forget which days I actually worked. This bot helps me track my work days so I don't miss any hours - because every hour counts when you're living the dream of being both a student and employee!

Wishing everyone success in finding their dream job! (Even if it means creating a bot to remember when you worked ðŸ˜…)
